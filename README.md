### Sort_Project (this is an active project)

Training Manager has been using excel to keep track of employee training. This has becoming cumbersome and hard to track. She is looking for a Dashboard to visualize training modules:
1. That are:
  * Over due
  * Due within 30 days
  * Due within 60 Days
  * Due within 90 days
  * Due in over 90 days
  
2. Show names, unit, and grade for each.

## Tableau Project
Tableau can be used to visual the compents about. 

The manager has provided a data set containing due dates for each module as of May 1, 2025. Many of the column names, and all of the employee names have randomized to protect privacy.

1. Suicide Prevention
2. Sexual Assault Prevention And Response
3. Religious Freedom Training
4. Brib Training
5. Ethics
6. New Employee Orientation
7. Force Protection Training
8. Environmental Training
9. Cyber Security
10. Cyber Awareness Challenge
11. Blood Borne Pathogens
12. HIPPA Training
13. Controlled Substances
14. Field Training
15. Site Controller
